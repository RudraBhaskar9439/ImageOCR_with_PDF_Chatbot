# üéØ Features
üì∏ Image OCR using Gemini Vision API

üìÑ PDF text extraction and processing


üîç Semantic search with sentence transformers


üí≠ Conversation memory for context-aware responses

üìä Similarity-based content retrieval

ü§ñ Integration with Google's Gemini AI

# üìã Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

Google Gemini API key

PDF documents and/or images to process

# üõ†Ô∏è Installation
## 1. Clone the repository
```python
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
```
## 2. Install required packages
```python
pip3 install google-generativeai sentence-transformers PyMuPDF langchain python-dotenv numpy Pillow
```
## 3. Set up environment variables
```python
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API key
```
# üìÅ Project Structure
```python
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ imageOCR.py           # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Folder_with_pdfs/     # Directory for PDFs and images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                  # Environment variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore           # Git ignore file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # Documentation
```

# üíª Usage
1. Place your files in the Folder_with_pdfs directory:

Supported image formats: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tiff, .bmp

Supported document format: .pdf

2. Run the script:

```python
python3 imageOCR.py
```

3. Interact with your documents:

```python
Enter your question (or 'quit' to exit): What text is visible in image1.jpg?
```

# ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Customize these parameters in the code:
```python
chunk_size = 1000          # Size of text chunks
chunk_overlap = 200        # Overlap between chunks
max_history = 5           # Conversation memory size
top_k = 3                # Number of relevant chunks
```

# üîí Security
Never commit your .env file

Keep your API keys secure

Use environment variables for sensitive data
